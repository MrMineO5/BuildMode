# BuildMode
A simple plugin to help your admins avoid breaking the map accidentally!

People with the buildemode.use permission must enable build mode to build, this can be changed by enabling plugin integrations.
## Plugin Integrations
Pluin integrations allow admins to build in certain places (for example their own plots) without enabling build mode!
- WorldGuard

Allows building in regions that allow everyone to build
